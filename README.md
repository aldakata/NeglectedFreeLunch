Supervised learning of image classifiers distills human knowledge into a parametric model *f* through pairs of images and corresponding labels (*X*,*Y*). We argue that this simple and widely used representation of human knowledge neglects rich auxiliary information from the annotation procedure, such as the time-series of mouse traces and clicks.

Our insight is that such **annotation byproducts** *Z* provide approximate human attention that weakly guides the model to focus on the foreground cues, reducing spurious correlations and discouraging shortcut learning. 

We have created **ImageNet-AB** and **COCO-AB** to verify this:

* [ImageNet-AB (annotation byproducts)](https://hybridsupervision-image-net.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/repository/imagenet_ab_v1_0.tar.gz) (Click to start downloading; 529MB)
* [COCO-AB (annotation byproducts)](https://hybridsupervision-coco.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hybridsup/coco_ab_v1_0.json) (Click to start downloading; 380MB)

They are ImageNet and COCO training sets enriched with sample-wise annotation byproducts, collected by replicating the respective original annotation tasks. 

We refer to the new paradigm of training models with annotation byproducts as **learning using annotation byproducts (LUAB)**.

<p/>

We show that a simple multitask loss for regressing *Z* together with *Y* already improves the generalisability and robustness of the learned models. Compared to the original supervised learning, LUAB does not require extra annotation costs.
